    "- 15: Adding combination of cards that sum to 15 points based on the face values.\n",
    "- pair: A pair of cards is worth 2 points. All combination of pairs are counted. For example if you have a triple (3 cards), that is worth 6 points as it yields 3 pairs from the combination of cars in the triple.\n",
    "- run: Similar to a straight in poker. At least 3 cards in seqential order by rank. Receive 1 point per card in the sequence. Be mindful of combinations, for example 3,4,4,5 is two runs of 3,4,5 worth 6 points (as a run)\n",
    "- flush: 4 or 5 cards (including the cut) with the same suit. When counting the crib, only 5 card flushes are valid.\n",
    "- nobs: If the hand contains the Jack of that matches the suit of the cut card that is worth 1 point.\n",
    "- nibs/heels: If the dealer cuts a Jack, the dealer receives 2 points."

The cards in a deck will be represented by two characters, the face value (A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K) and the suit (S, H, D, C). So the King of Spades would be: `KS` and the Two of Diamonds would be: `2D`. Face cards have a point value of 10, the ace is 1 Point and all other cards represent their value.\n",
